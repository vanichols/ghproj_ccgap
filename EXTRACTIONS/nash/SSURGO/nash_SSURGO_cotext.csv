08/22/2019 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,The Readlyn component makes up 95 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. This component is on interfluves on dissected till plains. The parent material consists of erosional sediments fine-loamy  over loamy till. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 5 percent. This component is in the R104XY005IA Loamy Upland Prairie Amorpha Canescens/andropogon Gerardii-sorghastrum Nutans (leadplant/big Bluestem-indiangrass) ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 1.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ,17587852,17544711
