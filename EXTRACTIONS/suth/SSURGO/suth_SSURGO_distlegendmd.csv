Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area,IA141,"O'Brien County, Iowa",NA,12/01/1977 00:00:00,"certified, major components",08/27/2019 13:23:29,"This county is involved in a Soil Data Join Recorrelation (SDJR) project that is occurring nationally in all MLRA areas of the U.S.    Map unit concepts will be identified using the NASIS map unit names and component data population, mapunit history text, correlation amendments, and published soil survey reports.  Map units and data map units that are named the same and occur in adjacent counties will be consolidated to share a single MLRA map unit so that data population and soil interpretations are consistent and survey area joins are improved. Publication map unit symbols for this project will stay the same. The new MLRA data mapunit will be developed using available data from existing data mapunits, NASIS pedons, transects, and Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) and university lab data. The new MLRA map unit will meet national standards.  The official series descriptions will be reviewed and updated during this process, along with all the KSSL laboratory data correlated names.
