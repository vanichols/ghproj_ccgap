08/22/2019 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,The Marcus component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on hillslopes on uplands. The parent material consists of fine-silty loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 7 percent. This component is in the R107AY209IA Wet Upland Sedge Meadow ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ,17553160,17509215

The parent material consists of fine-silty loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent. This component is in the R107AY201IA Loess Upland Prairie ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 1.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 15 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",17553086,17509141
