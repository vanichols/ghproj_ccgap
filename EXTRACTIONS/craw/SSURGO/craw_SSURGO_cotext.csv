09/08/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,Generated brief soil descriptions are created for major soil components.  The Sperry soil is a minor component.,17568392,17524540
09/08/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,The Taintor component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on interfluves on dissected till plains. The parent material consists of loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ,17568391,17524539
