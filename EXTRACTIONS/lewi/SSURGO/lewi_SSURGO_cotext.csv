09/09/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,The Marshall component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 2 to 5 percent. This component is on interfluves on uplands. The parent material consists of fine-silty loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 3 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2e.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ,18664145,18806112
