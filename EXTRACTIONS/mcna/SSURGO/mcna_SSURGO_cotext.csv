09/08/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,"The Arispe component makes up 85 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 5 to 9 percent. This component is on hillslopes on uplands. The parent material consists of loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is high. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during April, October. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent. This component is in the R109XY002MO Loess Upland Prairie  ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3e.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ",18658604,18798964
