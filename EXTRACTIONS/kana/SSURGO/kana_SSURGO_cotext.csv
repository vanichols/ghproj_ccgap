08/23/2016 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,GENSOIL,generated,"The Canisteo component makes up 75 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This component is on ground moraines on till plains. The parent material consists of fine-loamy till. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 7 percent. This component is in the R103XY001MN Loamy Wet Prairies ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.  This soil meets hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 17 percent.  ",17598861,17555807
